# Python-APIs

For this challenge, we've created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. This was accomplished by utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.<br/> 
<br/> 
The following scatter plots were built to showcase the following relationships:<br/> 
<br/> 
-Temperature (F) vs. Latitude<br/> 
-Humidity (%) vs. Latitude<br/> 
-Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude<br/> 
-Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude<br/> 
<br/> 
Final notebook will include:<br/> 
<br/> 
-Randomly select at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.<br/> 
-Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.<br/> 
-Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.<br/> 
-Save both a CSV of all data retrieved and png images for each scatter plot.<br/>
